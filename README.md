# Features

Zoom in/out of individual panes without affecting the entire interface

Create minimap-like views by linking a zoomed-out version of your current note

# Usage

Use the command palette to access zoom menu "Set Zoom Level for Current Pane"

Or assign a hotkey like Alt+Z to invoke it in your Obsidian hotkey settings (preferred method)

Link panes with different zoom levels for a minimap-like experience

# Installation

Until this plugin is ready for wider release, install it via the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) 

# Note
This is a very primitive implementation of an individual tab zoom feature. There is lots of room for improvement. There will probably be many changes/enhancements to come. Feel free to contribute or open an issue.
